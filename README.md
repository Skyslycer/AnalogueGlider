# AnalogueGlider

This watch face is perfect for glider enthusiasts and pilots featuring a beautiful drawing of a glider in the sunset.
It also shows the current local time using the analogue clock and UTC time in a HH:mm format under the image.
The current date is shown above the glider.

The glider image has been gladly provided by PureGlide.
